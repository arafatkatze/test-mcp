# MCP Real-Time Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented real-time MCP notification support in the Cline codebase, allowing notifications from MCP servers to be displayed immediately in the chat as they arrive, rather than being collected and displayed all at once after a tool completes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. McpHub.ts (`src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts`)
- Added a notification callback mechanism:
  - `notificationCallback` property to store the callback function
  - `setNotificationCallback()` method to set the callback
  - `clearNotificationCallback()` method to clear the callback
- Modified the notification handler to:
  - Send notifications directly to the active task via the callback when available
  - Fall back to storing in `pendingNotifications` when no active task
- Added debug logging to track notification flow

### 2. Task.ts (`src/core/task/index.ts`)
- Set up the notification callback in the constructor:
  ```typescript
  this.mcpHub.setNotificationCallback(async (serverName: string, level: string, message: string) => {
    await this.say("mcp_notification", `[${serverName}] ${message}`)
  })
  ```
- Clear the callback when the task is aborted to prevent memory leaks

## How It Works

1. **When a Task Starts**: The Task constructor sets up a notification callback with McpHub
2. **When Notifications Arrive**: The MCP server sends notifications via the `notifications/message` method
3. **Real-Time Display**: Instead of storing notifications, McpHub immediately calls the callback, which displays the notification in the chat
4. **When Task Ends**: The callback is cleared to prevent notifications from being sent to a completed task

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users see MCP server notifications as they happen
- **Better UX**: No more waiting until tool completion to see what the server is doing
- **Progress Tracking**: Servers can send progress updates that appear immediately
- **Debugging**: Real-time logs help debug MCP server behavior

## Testing

The implementation was tested with a custom MCP server that sends notifications with random delays. The notifications now appear in the chat immediately as they are sent, providing real-time feedback about the server's operations.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Types**: Support different notification types (info, warning, error) with different styling
2. **Notification Filtering**: Allow users to filter which notifications they want to see
3. **Notification History**: Keep a separate log of all notifications for debugging
4. **Progress Bars**: Support structured progress notifications with visual progress bars
